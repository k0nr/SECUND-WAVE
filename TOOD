- Living Newspaper (new 6/14!) link to previous week? 
    - figure out what the hell everyone was talking about in that email lol
    
    
    
i like this black/white/red and ALL CAPS motif, and I want to keep spinning out this sense of continuity. i think it would be jarring and dishonest to make a sudden break in design aesthetic (after two weeks of a single sustained narrative), especially after i put in all that effort to teach the expectation of novelty. novelty is a treat of other times. for now, we have to drive this narrative, and when you feel tired of the narrative (or even the 'aesthetic' of the narrative) maybe you should ask yourself why that is. 



plus it's... easier to make
jesus christ




when do we break away from it?
trust that that time will reveal itself
maybe weekend of juneteenth (6/21, next week)
